## Usage

This Prework Study Guide and Topic Selector Webpage can be used as a refresher for quick dot points of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. You can also have the webpage on your screen as a reminder of what certain terms of code stand for while coding yourself. 

It also has a Topic Selector in the DevTools console (accessed by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows)) which when opened on the side or below your browser it will select a topic out of HTML, CSS, Git or JavScript for you to study which is random each time you open the webpage to keep you up to date on all topics included.
